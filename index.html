      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Selin, and this website is my way of sharing more about
        myself—beyond what you’d find on a resume or LinkedIn profile. While
        those are here too, I wanted to create a space that feels more personal
        and gives a clearer sense of who I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite parts of this site is the
        <strong>Core Value Map</strong>, a visual representation of how my
        values guide the work I do and the goals I pursue. Feel free to explore
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also find a showcase of my projects and skills, along with a
        glimpse into the things that inspire me. I hope you enjoy exploring!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to get in touch—whether it’s to connect, collaborate, or
        just say hello—you can reach out to me <a href="#">here</a>.
