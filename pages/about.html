      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a senior Computer Science student at UBC, passionate about solving
        problems, managing projects, and collaborating with others to bring
        ideas to life. I enjoy creating structure and clarity in challenging
        situations, whether it’s organizing workflows, working in a team, or
        tackling technical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m grateful to have received the
        <strong>Karen McKellin International Leader of Tomorrow Award</strong>,
        a full-ride scholarship recognizing my achievements and potential. This
        recognition has inspired me to keep pushing boundaries and pursuing
        meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in roles that require problem-solving, organization, and clear
        communication. Whether leading a team or working alongside one, I
        prioritize collaboration and creating an environment where everyone
        feels supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics and work, I find joy in sailing—it’s a perfect mix
        of adventure and calm. I’m also an avid reader, drawn to philosophy,
        feminist literature, political analysis, and history, as these topics
        help me think critically and broaden my perspective. Photography is
        another passion of mine, offering a way to capture meaningful moments
        and appreciate the details of everyday life.
