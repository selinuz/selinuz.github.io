      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a senior Computer Science student at UBC, passionate about solving
        everyday problems, managing meaningful projects, and collaborating with
        others to bring ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m honored to have received the
        <strong>
          <a
            href="https://you.ubc.ca/financial-planning/scholarships-awards-international-students/international-scholars/"
            target="_blank">
            Karen McKellin International Leader of Tomorrow Award
          </a> </strong
        >, a full-ride scholarship that recognized my academic achievements and
        leadership potential during high school. This opportunity allowed me to
        move from my home country, Türkiye, to Canada to pursue my education and
        has further motivated me to push boundaries and strive for meaningful
        impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy sailing for its perfect mix of adventure
        and calm. I’m an avid reader of philosophy, feminist literature, and
        history, which help me think critically. Photography is another passion,
        letting me capture meaningful moments and appreciate everyday details.
